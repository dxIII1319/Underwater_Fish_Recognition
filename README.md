# Underwater_Fish_Recognition
This is a Research Project on Unsupervised Fish Recognition Framework for Underwater Images.
An advanced framework for fish recognition in underwater images, developed to handle challenges related to poor image quality and varying environmental conditions. This project utilizes unsupervised learning techniques to achieve high classification accuracy.

Features:

    Unsupervised Fish Recognition: Employs unsupervised learning methods to identify and classify fish in underwater images, overcoming the limitations of labeled data.
    Saliency-Based Techniques: Utilizes saliency maps to focus on relevant features and improve the accuracy of fish detection.
    Non-Rigid Part Modeling: Implements non-rigid part modeling to address variations in fish shapes and sizes, enhancing recognition accuracy.
    Binary Class Hierarchy with Partial Classification: Manages image ambiguity and class imbalance by designing a binary class hierarchy and partial classification approach.**
